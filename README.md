Interaction Design standards created by DfE Interaction Designers

My Interaction Design (IxD) Clan and I (Anne Chan) worked together to produce interaction design standards (e.g. principles and good practice for how we 'do' interaction design, ways of working etc). These have been reviewed by the wider DfE design community and adopted. We follow the same standards for more consistent and predictable designs which make our services more familiar and therefore easier to use for our users.
