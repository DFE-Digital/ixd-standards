Interaction Design standards created by DfE Interaction Designers

My Interaction Design (IxD) Clan and I (Anne Chan) worked together to produce interaction design standards (e.g. principles and good practice for how we 'do' interaction design, ways of working etc). These were compiled to compliment the GDS principles by providing more practical guidance on how to do what we do and what we should consider when designing services. 

These have been reviewed, iterated and adopted by the wider DfE design community. We follow the same standards for more consistent and predictable designs which make our services more familiar and therefore easier to use for our users.
