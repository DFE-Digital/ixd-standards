# ixd-standards
Interaction Design standards created Anne Chan, the SDD IxD Clan and DfE Interaction Designers

My Interaction Design (IxD) Clan and I (Anne Chan) worked together to produce interaction design standards (e.g. principles and good practice for how we 'do' interaction design, ways of working etc). These have been reviewed and extended to the wider DfE IxD community so we follow the same standards for more consistent and predictable designs which make our services more familiar and therefore easier to use for our users.
