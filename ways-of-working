# Ways of working
##what we do and how we do it

Defining our Interaction Design (IxD) ways of working gives us structure, direction and consistency to then do our best work, while for others, understanding what we do and how the team works leads to better collaboration and manages expectations.

## What we do
Explore design solutions by understanding users, mapping journeys and creating prototypes to test hypotheses and interactions which address user needs, behaviours and pain points while feeding into and supporting other disciplines.

 
## What we don't do
Fully functional services to GDS standard of coding

We use the prototyping kit to create prototypes for testing concepts and are not developers so our code isn't to GDS coding standards, and isn't expected to be. Prototypes are design artefacts, not an exact representation of the fully developed service with links to databases, validation, error handling and everything functioning - we only prototype what's needed for design / user testing.


## Being an Interaction Designer
There's more to being a designer than just the designing; we follow a number of techniques and approaches to become better designers...

- follow GDS principles of how to be an Interaction Designer (opens new tab)
- follow IxD Clan principles and good practice of how to do IxD
- collaborate with each other
- collaborate with other Clans
- work openly so we can be supported and can support others and reuse
- reuse patterns for consistency between services
- continually learn and develop
  - share prototypes, journey maps and other IxD outputs
  - document design decisions (what and why)
  - do Design Reviews so we have awareness of work, can support each other and address differences between services
  - document Design Review outcomes for future reference
  - centralise shared documents and IxD outputs in a single location
  - maintain design histories / handover docs
  - share working boards (Lucid / Figma)
 
 
## Stages of Interaction Design
Our approach uses a mix of cognitive, strategic and practical processes which we've grouped into 5 iterative and looping stages to help keep focus on users and their needs.

### Understand
Activities in this phase include:
- collaborate and feed into User Research (UR) so we learn how users behave, their needs and pain points and identify any gaps
- observe and scribe user testing
- feed into and understand personas / empathy maps
- analyse / understand user (and business) needs (behavioural, task-based, informational)
- understand the problem
- challenge assumptions
- review existing service(s)
- collaborate with Content Design (CD) and Service Design (SD) to understand and map the As-Is user journey
- create design histories (TBC if IxD or project team task
- review user stories reflect identified user needs
- stakeholder management (as appropriate)

### Define
Activities in this phase include:
- define (with the team) MVP / what to test / needs to be met
- challenge assumptions
- define tasks to complete
- create design histories (TBC if IxD task or team task)
- review user stories reflect identified user needs
- stakeholder management (as appropriate)

### Ideate
Activities in this phase include:
- explore concepts, options and journeys
- collaborate with UR to analyse and understand user needs (behaviours, task-based and informational needs) and identify gaps
- collaborate with CD / SD on information Architecture and journeys
- collaborate with devs to undestand what's possible / practical
- map solutions and needs
- mock up the experince (Low / high fidelity sketches / wireframes / prototypes - using the prototype kit)
- collaborative Design Reviews
- adhere to and champion accessibility standards
- adhere to and champion IxD principles and good practice
- reuse patterns and code as appropriate
- workshops
- documentation (design histories, design rationale, review BA user stories)
- share learnings
- collaborate and feed into User Research so we learn how users behave, their needs and pain points and identify any gaps
- stakeholder management (as appropriate)

### Refine
Activities in this phase include:
- collaborate and feed into User Research so we learn how users behave, their needs and pain points and identify any gaps
- evaluate and evolve / iterate prototypes / journeys based on UR or design review
- collaborative Design Reviews
- collaborate on dev build
- support accessibility testing
- documentation (design histories)
- share learnings
- stakeholder management (as appropriate)

### Iterate
Activities in this phase include:
- celebrate successes
- support UR
- learn and iterate cycle

 
## Interaction Design artefacts
We use a variety of tools to help us create Interaction Design outputs depending on the purpose, time available and what's "good enough" to meet the intended purpose which impact on the level of fidelity (level of detail/realism).

### Journey maps
- understanding user journeys at a high level; boxes and arrows using anything that works e.g. pen and paper, post-its, virtual whiteboard
- understanding the journey and expected contents at a medium level; use representative mini pages from a library in Figma or Lucid

### Prototypes
- understanding high level concepts for problem solving and discussion; Figma or Lucid
- testing interactions and journeys with users; interactive prototypes using GDS prototyping kit and Visual Studio
 
## Our documentation
Interaction Design is about more than just prototyping and journey mapping - we have other design outputs which help us to do our work, help with onboarding new team members and to better support or pick up each other's work.

Documentation we create, maintain and use:
- 'things' which help us to track of and document design rationale of our work:
  - design backlog for future consideration
  - collaborative Design Review feedback (design decisions made, why and any alternative designs)
  - design histories
  - agreed consistent approach to prototype versioning

- 'things' which help us stay up to date with each other
  - IxD updates document (updated weekly)
  - Clan Trello board for logging and tracking actions from Clan sessions
  - Clan slack channel

- 'things' we share and work on together
  - shared, reusbale Figma design library
  - central location for easy access to our IxD and Clan work
  - service differences Lucidspark board
  - behavioural needs Lucidspark board
  - Clan foundation activities Lucidspark boards


## Working as a Clan
Adopting a collaborative and supportive Clan culture is essential for us to build and grow as a team to deliver our best work.

How we work as a Clan:
- communicate with each other
  - celebrate successes
  - slack channel so we can communicate quickly
  - regular catch ups for wellbeing and relationship building
  - weekly IxD updates document to keep up to date with each other

- share skills, knowlege and experiences
  - share our work in a central location e.g. prototypes, journey maps, patterns...
  - weekly collaborative Design Reviews (keep up-to-date, explore alternatives, get and give feedback and improve consistency between the services)
  - coaching - share knowledge, skills and experiences so we learn from each other/together
  - discuss topics of interest
  - co-design workshops so we can support each other or learn

- improve delivery of services
  - compare services for consistency
  - maintain a backlog of identified opportunities for improvements
  - identify and collaborate on new patterns

- evolve the Clan
  - activities to evolve the Clan together so we grow together
  - create our Clan plan together so we're sharing doing what we want as a collective
 
 
## Collaborating with other Clans
For a truly User Centred Design (UCD) approach, the different professions need to work together to meet user needs.

### Collaborating with Content Designers

### Collaborating with User Researchers

### Collaborating with Developers

### Collaborating with Business Analysts
