As a Clan (team) we have pulled together a set of principles and good practices which we use for Interaction Design to provide consistency and guidance to how we apply design rationale and practices, leading to great interaction design and a great user experience.

We also design our services to meet the government design principles, and the service standard.

## Principle 1. Understand all users; needs, behaviours and pain points <a name="understand-all-users"></a>
...so that we understand all users and their needs with an ambition to meet them.

User needs come in different forms. Designing for information-based and task-based needs will lead to a service/journey which will allow users to complete their task(s) to see an outcome.
Understanding behaviour-based needs will improve the experience. It helps us to design how our users use the service. This means we can avoid 'fudges' and workarounds users might do to complete a task(s) they need to do.

### Good practice for understanding all users
You should:

- understand the research insights
- use needs-based personas
- consider both user needs (including accessibility needs) and business needs
- fix or mitigate user pain points
- factor in user behaviours
- understand 'how' the user does xyz
- understand 'why' the user does xyz
- think about what's missing (to feed into UR/workshops)

## Principle 2. Design accessibly from the start <a name="design-accessibly"></a>
...so that [we are inclusive - opens in new tab](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-more-inclusive). We need to design and deliver services that work for everyone.[Service standard 5 - opens in new tab](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-5-make-sure-everyone-can-use-the-service).

Designing for accessibly from the start reduces rework and time, is morally the right thing to do and is a legal requirement.

We design to meet [accessibility standard (opens in new tab)]().

### Legislation 
We may be breaking the law if we design services which are not accessible.

[Equality act 2010](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance) covers all public sector bodies.

### Good practice for accessibility 
You should:

- use sufficient background/foreground colour contrast
- use industry recommended sizes for interactive components
- design structure into pages (headings of different levels, lists...)
- visually indicate the page focus
- avoid images of text
- not represent information using just colour on its own
- find pains a user might have using a journey map to understand where the journey/paths are not easy to use by everyone

## Principle 3. Follow Gestalt laws <a name="gestalt-laws"></a>
...so that we design for natural human perception.

Gestalt laws are principles which relate to how people naturally perceive visual stimuli, group things together and simplify complex objects. Designers should use these to organise content to maximise natural perception:

### Gestalt laws to consider for good practice
You should:
- law of proximity
- law of closure
- law of similarity
- law of continuity

## Principle 4. Reduce cognitive load <a name="reduce-cognitve-load"></a>
...so that we don't overload users.

Unnecessary demands being made on users' mental capacity when completing a task can lead to feeling overwhelmed, anxious and frustrated while increasing mistakes. We should design to support user's short-term memory capacity and allow them to focus on one task at a time.

### Good practice for reducing cognitive load
You should:

- prefill data (if/when the user gives consent)
- use summary pages to playback to users (give options to go back easily and amend)
- make it easy to compare data from different sources
- follow Miller's law (chunking) to help memory limitations
- apply progressive disclosure

## Principle 5. Support / prevent users making mistakes <a name="mistakes"></a>
...so that users make less errors and can recover from mistakes.

Making mistakes can be frustrating and increase anxiety when users are interacting with a service. To avoid these negative emotions, we should design to reduce the chance of users making mistakes but also for recovery when mistakes do occur.

### Good practice for helping users
You should:

- allow users to undo actions
- provide confirmation of actions - for example, save and delete
- provide logical options for checkboxes / radio buttons
- think error recovery and error prevention
- make users explicity confirm destructive actions. For example, are you sure you want to delete?
- add helpful context - for example, use hint text
- include helpful validation messages

## Principle 6. Make users do less <a name="do-less"></a>
...so that the experience is faster and easier for users. [Service standard 4 - opens in new tab](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-4-make-the-service-simple-to-use)

A series of additional interactions add up to an experience littered with unnecessary interactions which slow the user down and increase effort. Remove unnecessary interactions when the user can achieve the same goal with less effort and it doesn't impact on their ability to process information. What seems like small interactions will add up to incremental improvements to the overall experience.

### Good practice for making users do less
You should:

- pre-populate, auto filter, remove redundancies
- avoid unnecessary or extra interactions / provide short cuts
- reduce scrolling - for example, use back to top, anchor links
- follow Fitt's law - time relative to size and distance
- reduce repetitive interactions

## Principle 7. Consider context <a name="context"></a>
...so that we are designing for user's circumstances and so users understand their circumstances in relation to using the service.

Understanding users' circumstances helps us to design for their constraints. Providing context helps users to understand where they are and what they can to do next. Provide information and functionality in context - at the point the user is most likely to need it. Save the user hunting for it, or missing it altogether.

All these context related considerations should help manage user expectations, leading to a clearer experience.

### Good practice for context
You should:

- avoid dead-ends
- explain what will happen next
- tell users what they need
- access to / content at the point users need it
- indicate timescales
- consider the end-2-end journey
- consider environment, IT confidence, pressures and constraints
- provide timely system feedback

## Principle 8. Design a seamless experience <a name="seamless"></a>
...so that the user experience is familiar and predictable.

Users learn how a service looks and works as they are using it. By having consistent designs and interactions, we are helping users to learn more quickly, building on their familarity and re-enforcing their mental models of how to interact with the services.

### Good practice for designing a seamless experience

You should:
- re-use patterns / code where possible and appropriate to conform with user expectations
- avoid bespoke designs where possible
- make sure systems look / behave the same
- maintain documentation e.g. Design histories, design decisions, other IxD dcoumentation

## Principle 9. Design with data and design logic <a name="data-and-logic"></a>
...so that everything is grounded in insights and evidence to provide robust design rationale.

Insights and design rationale are essential to designing services which meet user needs and expectations. As opposed to creating shiny new functionality which confuses users, is unused or even hinders their use of the service.

### Good practice for designing with data and design logic
You should:

- ensure designs are testing hypothesis
- ensure features are fulfilling a user need
- ensure design rationale exists for design decisions
- follow User Centred Design best practice
- remove unnecessary components which are not intent driven or do not add value
